## Implementation Steps

To implement these changes in your Supabase project:

1. **Run the updated schema**:
   ```sql
   -- Run the contents of supabase/schema.sql
   ```

2. **Run the triggers**:
   ```sql
   -- Run the contents of supabase/triggers.sql
   ```

3. **Update Supabase Authentication Settings**:
   - Disable email confirmation
   - Ensure email provider is enabled

4. **Test the application**:
   - Create admin and counselor accounts
   - Test application creation and management
   - Test notes functionality
   - Verify role-based access controls
